# Semantic Search Guide

## Overview

The semantic search feature allows users to find notes based on **meaning and context** rather than just exact keyword matches. It uses AI embeddings to understand the semantic similarity between the search query and note content.

## üß† How It Works

### Embedding-Based Search
1. **Query Processing**: Your search query is converted into a high-dimensional vector (embedding) using the same AI model used for notes
2. **Similarity Calculation**: The system compares your query embedding with all note embeddings using cosine similarity
3. **Ranking**: Results are ranked by semantic similarity score (0-100%)
4. **Snippet Generation**: Relevant excerpts are extracted from matching notes

### AI Model
- **Model**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (Sentence Transformers)
- **Dimensions**: 384-dimensional embeddings
- **Language**: Optimized for English text
- **Performance**: Fast inference, good semantic understanding

## üîç Using Semantic Search

### Frontend Interface

**Location**: Notes page ‚Üí Semantic Search section

**Search Input**:
- Type natural language queries
- Examples: "machine learning algorithms", "data structures", "web development"
- No need for exact keyword matching

**Options**:
- **Max Results**: 5, 10, 15, or 20 results
- **Min Similarity**: 20%, 30%, 40%, or 50% threshold

**Results Display**:
- **Similarity Score**: Percentage match (color-coded)
- **Snippet**: Relevant excerpt from the note
- **Actions**: Open, Find Similar, Locate in list

### Search Examples

#### Good Semantic Queries
```
‚úÖ "artificial intelligence and machine learning"
‚úÖ "sorting algorithms and data organization" 
‚úÖ "building web applications with JavaScript"
‚úÖ "database design and data modeling"
‚úÖ "object-oriented programming concepts"
```

#### Less Effective Queries
```
‚ùå "the" (too generic)
‚ùå "a b c" (random letters)
‚ùå "12345" (numbers without context)
```

## üîß API Endpoints

### POST /search/semantic
```http
POST /search/semantic
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "query": "machine learning algorithms",
  "max_results": 10,
  "min_similarity": 0.3
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "query": "machine learning algorithms",
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "note_id",
      "title": "Machine Learning Basics",
      "content": "Full note content...",
      "similarity_score": 0.85,
      "snippet": "Machine learning algorithms are computational methods..."
    }
  ],
  "total_results": 5,
  "search_time_ms": 45.2
}
```

### GET /search/semantic
```http
GET /search/semantic?q=machine%20learning&max_results=5&min_similarity=0.3
```

## üìä Understanding Similarity Scores

### Score Ranges
- **70-100%** üü¢ **High**: Very relevant, strong semantic match
- **50-69%** üü° **Medium**: Moderately relevant, good conceptual match  
- **30-49%** üî¥ **Low**: Somewhat relevant, weak but meaningful connection
- **0-29%** ‚ö´ **Very Low**: Minimal relevance (usually filtered out)

### Factors Affecting Scores
- **Concept Overlap**: Shared ideas and themes
- **Terminology**: Similar technical vocabulary
- **Context**: Related problem domains
- **Semantic Relationships**: Synonyms, related concepts

## üí° Best Practices

### Writing Effective Queries

1. **Use Natural Language**: Write as you would speak
   - ‚úÖ "How to implement sorting algorithms"
   - ‚ùå "sort algorithm implement"

2. **Include Context**: Add domain or context words
   - ‚úÖ "machine learning classification algorithms"
   - ‚ùå "classification"

3. **Use Specific Terms**: Technical terms work well
   - ‚úÖ "neural networks and deep learning"
   - ‚ùå "AI stuff"

4. **Combine Concepts**: Link related ideas
   - ‚úÖ "database design and normalization"
   - ‚ùå "database"

### Optimizing Search Results

1. **Adjust Similarity Threshold**:
   - **High threshold (50%+)**: Fewer, more precise results
   - **Low threshold (20-30%)**: More results, broader matches

2. **Vary Query Phrasing**:
   - Try different ways to express the same concept
   - Use synonyms and related terms

3. **Use Domain-Specific Language**:
   - Technical terms often yield better results
   - Include field-specific vocabulary

## üéØ Use Cases

### Academic Research
```
"reinforcement learning and reward systems"
"statistical analysis and hypothesis testing"
"quantum computing and quantum algorithms"
```

### Software Development
```
"microservices architecture and design patterns"
"API development and RESTful services"
"frontend frameworks and component libraries"
```

### Data Science
```
"data preprocessing and feature engineering"
"time series analysis and forecasting"
"natural language processing techniques"
```

### General Learning
```
"mathematical concepts in computer science"
"project management methodologies"
"user experience design principles"
```

## ‚ö° Performance

### Typical Response Times
- **Small collections** (<100 notes): 10-50ms
- **Medium collections** (100-1000 notes): 50-200ms
- **Large collections** (1000+ notes): 200-500ms

### Optimization Tips
1. **Use appropriate similarity thresholds** to limit results
2. **Limit max_results** for faster responses
3. **Cache frequent queries** (future enhancement)
